I have been a member of [F3 Nation](https://f3nation.com) since 2014 where I answer to the nickname "Blackbeard". I established and continue to support the [F3 Lake Norman](https://f3lakenorman.com) regional website where I continually add features and keep on top of security updates. I also implemented [Slack](https://slack.com) as a communication tool for the region and have added several integrations to make the app more functional for our needs.
