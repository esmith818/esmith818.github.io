### Career Overview

### Personal

I have been a member of [F3 Nation](https://f3nation.com) since 2014 where I answer to the nickname "Blackbeard". I established and continue to support the [F3 Lake Norman](https://f3lakenorman.com) regional website where I continually add features which present collected data in useful ways. I wrote a Python script that I host on a Raspberry Pi which monitors Twitter for tagged content and retweets. I also implemented [Slack](https://slack.com) as a communication tool for the region, and have added several integrations to make the app more functional for our needs.

I am currently serving on the Villages of Rosedale HOA board where I am initiating a better solution for managing HOA materials, implementing a solution which will allow townhome owners to address their needs without requiring votes from single family owners, and working on improved relations between the HOA and the property owners.

I serve on the Pastoral Council at St Mark Catholic Church where I have been an active member since 1998. I have previously volunteered with their high school youth in both [LifeTeen](https://lifeteen.com) and [Fraternus](https://www.fraternus.net).
