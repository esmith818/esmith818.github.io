### Eric Smith

### Career Overview
My father taught me to leave things in better condition than I found them. I seek to apply this statement to every project I am involved with. I have a habit of finding problems, but I use that to my advantage in making further improvements. And as someone who believes in working smarter rather than harder, I seek out opportunities to automate processes whenever possible. Improvement and automation are key factors to my recent career move into project management and IT business analysis.
