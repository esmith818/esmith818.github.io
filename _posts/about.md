## The Author

I am a graduate of NC State University who switched from Computer Science to Business back in the late 1980s after deciding I did not want to spend my life sitting in front of a computer. Terminator seemed like science fiction and Wall-E had not been released yet so the idea of life without computers still seemed viable. But with a so-so GPA, my new outlooks were bank teller and superstore manager so I opted to enroll at a technical school to learn about computer graphics. That led to a career in printing. I've stayed in the print communications industry ever since while serving in mulitple roles including preflight, prepress, systems administration and variable data. I currently wear mulitple hats as I shuffle between [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) development, some JavaScript coding, and learning how to load test with [jMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/).

## The Website

When I'm not working, I enjoy tinkering with technology. I tend to get interested in something until I figure out how it ticks and then move on to the next puzzle. As a result, I don't have a strong command of any one discipline, but rather a vague understanding of how many things work. Combine that with a terrible memory and you have a guy who has forgotten much of what he learned. Thank God we have the internet now so that we can write down information as we gather it to review later when it is needed again. The reason this site has any chance of making it past my interest in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) is that hosting is free with my [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
