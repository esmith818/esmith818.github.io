Hi, I'm Blackbeard and this is where I keep my brain dumps as I learn of new and interesting solutions to problems I come across. I learn by doing, and I remember by writing things down. It was only natural that I would seek out an easy markdown solution for taking notes online.

## Professional

My real name is Eric Smith, and I am a graduate of NC State University who switched from Computer Science to Business back in the late 1980s after deciding I did not want to spend my life sitting in front of a computer. Terminator seemed like science fiction and Wall-E had not been released yet so the idea of life without computers still seemed viable. 

After college, I found my way into printing. I moved quickly from prepress into variable data where I was able to return to programming, albeit using a language that didn't exist back in college. This led to working with developers to produce B2B websites that generated print content on the fly. From there it was a natural transition from back-end to front-end where I could merge my JavaScript skills with PHP and Python. 

When an opportunity opened up to move into a project manangement and analyst role, I jumped. This position allows me to apply my technical background in finding ways to automate and improve existing processes.

## Personal

When I'm not improving client solutions, I enjoy tinkering with technology. I never cared for learning by completing simple tutorials, preferring instead to apply a solution to a existing problem. 

This has led to an automated home theater setup, a whole-house ad blocking solution, a scripted bot for filtering important announcements through a centralized Twitter account, and a custom Garmin watch face to promote a men's fitness group I am a proud member of. 

I currently sit on boards for my fitness group, my church and my neighborhood. In each case, I am always seeking out ways to apply order, automation and improvement.
